The Eclipse "-showlocation" startup parameter causes the current location of the workspace to be displayed in the title bar (status bar) of the Eclipse window.

The "-showlocation" option can either be specified on the command line when Eclipse is started or in the eclipse.ini file (which resides where the eclipse binary has been installed).

Command Line
eclipse -showlocation

.eclipse.ini (in the same directory as the eclipse (eclipse.exe windows) binary resides)

Examples:

Windows
c:\Program Files\eclipse\.eclipse.ini

Linux
/usr/local/eclipse/.eclipse.ini
~/.eclipse.ini

Mac
/Applications/eclipse/.eclipse.ini
